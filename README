MVAPICH2 is a high performance MPI-2 implementation (with initial support for
MPI-3) for InfiniBand, 10GigE/iWARP and RoCE.  MVAPICH2 delivers best
performance, scalability and fault tolerance for high-end computing systems and
servers.  MVAPICH2 provides underlying support for several interfaces (such as
OFA-IB, OFA-iWARP, OFA-RoCE, PSM, Shared Memory, and TCP) for portability
across multiple networks.

This package uses the basic GNU build system.  To install a default build of
MVAPICH2 from the release tarball you can issue the following commands:

    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/mvapich2
    make            # make -j<num threads> for parallel build
    make install    

The latest MVAPICH2 release tarball can be downloaded from:

If you are downloading MVAPICH2 from svn, you can use the following steps to
install a default build.

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/mvapich2
    make            # make -j<num threads> for parallel build
    make install
